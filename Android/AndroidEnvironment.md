# Setting up your Environment

Here are a few preliminary steps you would need to follow in order to get your development environment all ready for building you first app. 

#### Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)

----------

#### Create an Android Project 

The minimum supported version for the Android project is 15 (4.0.3).

See the Android [Thermometer demo](https://github.com/relayr/android-demo-apps/commit/3e33f01c7e693e5ee0f9884dea8218731b8c9c8b) for detailed instructions. 

----------

   
####  Reference the relayr SDK project in the build.gradle file inside your app folder:
	    
	    dependencies {
	        compile 'io.relayr:android-sdk:0.0.1'
	    }

----------
