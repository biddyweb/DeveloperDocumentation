# relayr for Android Developers 

Welcome to the relayr Android Documentation, we are genuinely excited to have you on board!
The Android SDK is available for download from the [relayr Android SDK Repository](https://github.com/relayr/android-sdk) on GitHub.

The Android SDK provides you with programmatic access points to the relayr API, it allows you to use the relayr [Cloud Platform](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Welcome/Platform) in your application and handle Bluetooth Low Energy connection to your sensor modules and other devices.

## Building your First relayr Android App 

We realize that you probably want to skip introductions and get down to building your app so we've created a [step by step tutorial](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/BuildingApp) explaining how to create a simple thermometer application, using the temperature sensor available on the WunderBar and the Android SDK.

## Sample Projects

We've built an easy to implement, quick and simple <a href="https://github.com/relayr/android-demo-apps/tree/master/thermometer">Thermometer application</a> to get you introduced to the relayr Android world. We've also created a fun and simple Can'tTouchThis application to give you an idea of how you could utilize our Cloud platform and live sensor data. Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/relayr/android-cant-touch-this">Can'tTouchThis app on GitHub</a> for additional information. In addition, check out our recently released app [TellMeWhen](https://github.com/relayr/android-tell-me-when) which is also open source and allows you to receive notifications based on rules you create concerning the different sensor measurements.
