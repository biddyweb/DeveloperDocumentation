# The relayr Android SDK 

Welcome to the relayr Android SDK, we are genuinely excited to have you on board!
All references in this section are to the [relayr Android SDK Repository](https://github.com/relayr/android-sdk)

The Android SDK provides you with programmatic access points to the relayr API, it allows you to use the relayr [Cloud Platform](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Welcome/Platform) in your application and in the future - handle Bluetooth LE connection to your sensor modules. 

We realize that you probably want to skip introductions and get down to building your app so here are the first steps to [get you started](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/GettingStarted).

## Sample Projects

We've built an easy to implement, quick and simple <a href="https://github.com/relayr/android-demo-apps/tree/master/thermometer">Thermometer application</a> to get you introduced to the relayr Android world. We've also created a fun and simple Can'tTouchThis application to give you an idea of how you could utilize our Cloud platform and live sensor data.
