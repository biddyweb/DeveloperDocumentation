## I am a Web developer

We realize not everyone is an Android or an iOS developer. This is why this section is dedicated to you - front end developers who would like to use the relayr <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Welcome/Platform" target="_blank"> Cloud Platform </a> to bring things to life.  

Here you will find [code samples](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/WEB/WebDevelopers) which explain how to use our data distribution service in order to receive data from the devices, and a <a href="https://github.com/relayr/android-demo-apps/tree/master/thermometer">sample project</a> designed for Web to get you inspired.
