## I am a Web developer

We realize not everyone is an Android or a iOS developer. This is why this section is dedicated to you - front end developers who would like to use the relayr <a href="https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Welcome/Platform" target="_blank"> Cloud Platform </a> to bring things to life. 

Here you will find [code samples](/WEB/CodeSamples) which explain how to use our data distribution service in order to receive data from the devices, and a [sample project](/WEB/SampleProject) designed for Web to get you inspired.
