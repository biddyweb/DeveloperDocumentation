#What’s ahead?

We are constantly working to improve our platform and provide you with additional fascinating options of integration and usage. Here’s a quick recap of what we are planning for the next phase of development.

<div class="category">
<h2>Conditional Messaging</h2>
<p>
You’d be able to receive data update messages based on a set of rules which you will determine. For example: “Send message when the temperature reading on my thermometer exceeds 30 degrees”. This will also entail putting a a Server State mechanism which will allow you to request the current state of your device.</p>

<h2>Outsource Board Designs</h2>
<p>Yes, you too will be able to print out your very own WunderBar based on our designs.</p>

<div class="category">
<h2>Historical Data View</h2> 
<p>Your accumulated data will now be available on the Developer Dashboard. This will be backed by an API which would allow the querying of historical data.</p>

<div class="category">
<h2>Mock Devices</h2>
<p>For those of you who do not own a WunderBar, we are adding a mock device which behaves exactly like an actual device and will enable you to experiment with the platform before you purchase your own WunderBar</p>

<div class="category">
<h2>Integration with other iOT Devices</h2>
<p>We wouldn’t want to limit you to our WunderBar; that’s why we are planning on adding multiple iOT devices such as wristbands, home appliances and many more smart solutions all for your benefit.</p>

<div class="category">
<h2>Public Devices</h2>
<p>Don’t keep your devices to yourself - make them public! share the your gathered data with others! Allow others to use your readings with their apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="category">
<h2>The relayr Gallery</h2>
<p>Showcase your smart solutions on the relayr gallery. relayr is where you draw attention to what you’ve built.</p>
</div>


<p style="text-align:center;width:100%">This is just a part of what we have in store for you. Stay tuned for more relayr innovation.</p>
