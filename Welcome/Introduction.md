# Welcome to the relayr Documentation Center 

## relayr is all about bringing things to life, it's about allowing app developers access to the physical world around them.

## We've made it as easy as possible for you to start integrating your awesome apps with the relayr platform. Here are a few tips to get you started:

### You may want to start by having a look at our [Authorization Protocol](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Authorization/Reference) which provides a general overview of OAuth as well as an explanation how the protocol has been implemented on the relayr platform.

### If you are an Android developer, be sure to get inspired by our [Android SDK](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Android/Reference) which provides all the tools you need in order to integrate your Android projects with our platform. All available Endpoints and code samples just waiting to be implemented.

### If your passion is iOS - don't worry, we have not forgotten you. You are more than welcome to check out our [iOS Framework](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/iOS/Reference) for available Endpoints, code samples and all you need to integrate your iOS project with the relayr platform.

### Our [Registration API](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/Registration/Users) includes a detailed list of all endpoints and use cases of the relayr Registration API. 
 
### We've also included information about how we've integrated with our data distribution service - PubNub. To read all about it, have a look at our [PubNub Introduction](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/PubNub/Reference)
