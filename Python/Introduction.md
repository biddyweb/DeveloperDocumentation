# relayr for Pythonists

Welcome to the relayr Python Library Documentation. [The repository](https://github.com/relayr/python-sdk) provides Python developers with  programmatic access points to the relayr platform.

These include access to the relayr cloud via the [relayr API](https://developer.relayr.io/documents/relayrAPI/Introduction) as well as direct connection to the relayr WunderBar sensors, via Bluetooth Low Energy (using [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/) on Linux). 


## Installation

You can install the library using one of the following methods, using Pip: 

1. You can download the very latest version of the repository from GitHub:

    	pip install git+https://github.com/relayr/python-sdk

2. You may use the following to install the package from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/relayr/) 

    
		pip install relayr


## Usage Examples


### Switching on/off an LED light on a device:


		from relayr import Client
		c = Client(token='<my_access_token>')
    	d = c.get_device(id='<my_device_id>')
    	d.switch_led_on(True)

### Receiving data from a device:

		import time
		from relayr import Client
		c = Client(token='<my_access_token>')
		d = c.get_device(id='<my_device_id>').get_info()
		def callback(message, channel):
		    print(repr(message), type(message))
		user = c.get_user()
		conn = user.connect_device(d, callback)
		conn.start()
		time.sleep(10)
		conn.stop()
